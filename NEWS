Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.007
========================================================

* Do not assume filenames are UTF8-encoded; pass the strings on unaltered in
  both directions, C to Perl and Perl to C.  Before passing a filename on to
  something which expects UTF8 (like widgets), users now have to ensure that it
  is UTF8-encoded.  Glib::filename_to_unicode provides one way to do this.

========================================================

* Remove an unneeded argument of an internal function

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.004
========================================================

* Fix building test libraries on Ubuntu 11.10.  They (Ubuntu devs) added
  --as-needed to the default linker flags, and that breaks building the test
  libraries for reasons I don't understand at the moment.  So simply add
  --no-as-needed for now.
* Properly check for definedness throughout; Use gperl_sv_is_defined instead
  of a direct comparison against &PL_sv_undef.

Overview of changes in Glib::Object::Introspection 0.003
========================================================

* Nothing, except for adding the NEWS entries that were forgotten for
